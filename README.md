### Infinity & Beyond Days of Code
I joined the 100 Days of Code around May 2021 to challenge myself to be immersed in working on projects and/or learning/improving programming related skills, knowledge or concepts and as of this writing (16 November 2021) - I'm on Day 223.

**codewurld/codewurld** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

A highly motivated, ambitious individual who takes great pride in carrying out work on projects to a high standard. Designed and engineered projects on GitHub with an aim to cement what I have learnt; successfully advancing my knowledge of advanced coding techniques with the use of online courses. As a visual person, I take great care in ensuring my applications are pleasing to the eye, and easy to use; the user experience is a very important part of what I do.

ðŸŒ± I enjoy helping people who are struggling as I have found this to be a further opportunity to cement my knowledge and I am really excited about this new phase of my life, and where it can take me in the future.
